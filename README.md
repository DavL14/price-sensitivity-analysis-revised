# Price Sensitivity Analysis Revised
Revised edition of a simple program that outputs the PSM (Price Sensitivity Measurement) Analysis from certain .csv file.

Price Sensitivity Measurement (PSM) Analysis is a statistical method used to determine the optimal pricing for products or services based on how willing customers are to pay at different price points. This project demonstrates the application of PSM analysis on a dataset to find the highest price, compromise price, ideal price, and lowest quality assurance price. The analysis was initially conducted manually using Microsoft Excel, where graphs were drawn and key price points were identified. Subsequently, a TypeScript program was created to automate the extraction and display of these price points from the processed data.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager): These are essential to run the TypeScript program.
- TypeScript: The project's codebase is written in TypeScript, which requires the TypeScript compiler to run.
- A text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that supports TypeScript, such as Visual Studio Code.

Execute the program by running: "ts-node psm.ts --csvfile PSMrawdata" in the terminal.
